The Universal Basic Income Project


### *WHAT* IS THE GOAL?
The long term goal is to implement a national UBI in Canada (and ultimately around the world). The mid-term goal is to make UBI a commonly-known and accepted strategy. The short-term goal is to inform 10 people who aren’t familiar with basic income, and have them “accept” and share the idea.

### *WHO* ARE WE DESIGNING FOR?
The target demographic is anyone in Canada who is either vaguely or not at all familiar with UBI. The main hurdle in speaking to the common person about socioeconomic policy will very likely be catching and keeping their interest.

### *HOW* DO WE GET THOSE PEOPLE TO OUR GOAL?
In terms of the brand, it needs to be friendly, engaging and delightful to the user. They’re not going to be enticed to read an article or browse through an infographic, or article on UBI if they have no interest or knowledge of UBI. However, one thing that most people are interested in is money and how to get more of it. By putting the focus on the $1000 a month (it’s actually higher than that now, but 1000 is simpler), it creates a motivator to move the user through the story. As the user proceeds through the story, they will learn more about how this $1000 per month is part of a system called UBI, and they’ll learn the benefits and address the common concerns in a friendly, narrative survey-styled, story. 

It will be key to keep the user engaged through delightful micro-interactions as more and more content is brought forth. The content should be light and easy to read, with external links for more info to keep the user moving forward. By the end of it, the user will either choose to “sign up” or decline. Since there isn’t a way for them to just “sign up” to basic income, this will direct them to the next best thing; a list of actionable items they can take part in to help implement UBI in Canada. 

To begin, the strategy will simply be to meet the short term goal to prove that the idea is working. I want to keep my “acceptance” or conversion rate above 50%, and to do this, I will need to facilitate discussion further from the users as to why they did or why they didn’t “convert”. This will help me adjust the content as time goes on to make sure that I can address any common questions that aren’t currently included, or double down on the content that is working.
