So far, 98% of the people who have taken this survey also agree. This actually makes quite a bit of sense, because there have been many studies to show us that we tend to be <a href='//www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation'>driven by internal motivators</a> such as mastery, purpose and autonomy.

Am I right?</p>","Yes, I’m sure you’ve been told this patronizingly for most of your life. However, there is actually a system which has been proposed where this money could be accessible to every citizen of Canada. There is some restructuring involved, and your taxes could possibly increase by a couple percent. However, this would ensure that every single citizen is able cover their necessities of life.","To give every Canadian <b>$1000</b> every month for one year, it would cost: <div class='numerals'><span class='single'>35,160,000</span><span class='description'>(Canadian population)</span><br> × 1000 <span class='description'>($1000 dollars each)</span><br><div class='result'><span class='single'>$35,160,000,000</span> <span class='description'>(cost per month)</span></div><span class='single'>$35,160,000,000</span><span class='description'>(cost per month)</span><br>× 12 <span class='description'>(months in a year)</span><br><div class='result'><span class='single'>$4,219,200,000,000</span> <span class='description'>(annual expense)</span></div> <strong><span class='single'>$421,920,000,000</span></strong> </div> Oh dear!

This means for every $100 you pay towards social services through tax, approximately only $33 of that is being spent on the people it is intended to go to. It’s estimated that replacing these programs with the Universal Basic Income would save over {$400,000,000 per year}. </div> </div> <div class='row'> <div class='icon'></div> <div class='source'> <span class='source-header'>Source: 2</span> <span class='source-title'>Savings From Costly Poverty</span> Poverty is not only costly to the individual, but it’s extremely costly to the country.

A Universal Basic Income, coupled with a flat tax, is capable of mimicking all aspects of our current progressive (bracketed) taxation scheme, but without brackets. Everyone will, at the start of each year, know precisely what their taxes will look like. All marginal tax rates will be identical, while the Universal Basic Income ensures that net-taxes follow a progressive-tax structure. </div> </div> </div> So, where are we at right now? We now understand that we are able to give every {Canadian} <b>$1000</b> every month with some restructuring. And we understand that people aren’t going to just use this money to become “lazy, no good, system suckers”. <p>But, you’re a very critical thinker, and I’m assuming you still have more questions. Perhaps, you believe that this would inflate our economy?</p>","The program cuts we mention above don’t have to be all or nothing. For example, disability and pensions can exist in smaller forms on top of UBI and still drastically reduce overhead costs. For those who are actually disabled and require more money above the UBI, we have two viable options. 1.  Universal Health Care can potentially take care of these costs entirely or at least partially. 2.  We top up those who need more, so if someone is currently getting $1,500 per month on disability and needs the extra $500, we give them the extra $500 through the disability program. Hey now, what about nuking bureaucracy!? Isn’t this a program that requires administration? You’re right, it is. However, it's now much smaller and needs fewer people. If the department right now is handling 2 applications for disability per 100 workers, and after UBI that goes down to 0.5 or less, that's at least a 75% reduction in the workload, and thus potentially a 75% reduction in overhead. So say instead of requiring a department of 1,000 federal employees, it can be a department of 250 or less. That's less bureaucracy and less potential for fraud and waste.","Inflation is not the unmanageable danger it is made out to be. There are multiple factors which counter the fear of inflation: <br>•  A basic income will be set at a basic level <br>•  We have actual evidence <br>•  Capitalism will actually be enhanced <br>•  Technology will continue to advance and make goods like housing cheaper <br>•  Our economic capacity is underutilized and underconsumption is systemic <br>This has been one of the most numerous concerns with implementing a Universal Basic Income, and has been asked so many times, that Scott Santens has compiled many sources, examples, studies, and insight as to how inflation would not be affected through a UBI in a helpful article here. Assuming the BI is funded via taxes, and not monetary policy (printing money), any inflationary impact should be short-term and limited to where supply is sticky. Ok, so now that we’re past that hurdle. Since you started this survey, there has probably been one question in your head that hasn’t been addressed yet… Why is this even necessary?","Humans have been utilizing technology to create more effective production for thousands of years. As we witnessed in the industrial revolution (and all technological revolutions since the dawn of time), with the advent of new technology <br>•  efficiency increased <br>•  accuracy increased <br>  <br>•  speed increased <br>•  consistency increased <br>•  power increased <br>•  and ultimately production increased The same is happening with the automation revolution, however there is one major difference. The previous revolutions have brought about new technologies, new jobs, and new opportunities for humans to contribute to. With this current situation however, new jobs are being created at a much smaller rate than ever before. It’s expected that {7,000,000 Canadian} jobs will be lost due to automation by the year 2020, while only {2,000,000} new jobs will spawn from these changes. That’s {5,000,000} jobs lost in under 3 years. In fact, our current situation is similar to a game of musical chairs where the chairs represent jobs. However, when the music stops, and someone is left without a chair, they aren’t just out of the game, they are left to stand in the hot coals of poverty. It’s said that these coals are supposed to motivate us to try and get a chair, but as we know now, there are simply not enough chairs for everyone to sit, and people will be burnt for no fault of their own. So this game sounds kind of disturbingly twisted, don’t you think? Now, let’s take this same game, but add a {10cm} thick concrete pad between the chairs and the coals. The pad is still pretty warm, because it’s directly above the coals, but it’s enough to prevent the players from getting burnt. We actually have a system which would automatically and incrementally add a millimeter of concrete as our economy grows stronger. So, essentially, the less chairs that exist, the thicker our concrete pad becomes, and the more comfortable it is to do whatever we choose on that pad. We are, with every day, becoming more and more productive as a society, and this will continue exponentially as our technology becomes more and more advanced. When our society is more productive, our economy becomes stronger. When our economy becomes stronger, our quality of life increases. This all sounds a little better, doesn’t it?","<p>Although, I am sorry to admit, this system isn’t quite available yet.
